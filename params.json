{"name":"Sarus","tagline":"[sahr-uhs]","body":"Sarus is a framework built on HTML5, AngularJS and (optionally) nodeJS in the backend.\r\nIt provides unlimited scroll for your content while maintaining urls references in the browser, hence making sure there is no compromise on SEO.\r\n\r\nThis project is under active development, though documentation is lacking miserably. However, code has been well commented in the master branch and should not cause pain to the developers.\r\nFor the rest, it will be done before this month end.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectsarus)\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by [Aditya](https://twitter.com/adityaraj),\r\n[Arijit](https://twitter.com/fotuzlab) and \r\n[Ravish](https://twitter.com/ray1claw)\r\n\r\n\r\nSponsored by [Srijan Technologies](http://srijan.net)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
